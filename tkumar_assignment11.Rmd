The purpose of this assignment is to formulate and solve an integer programming problem.

```{r}
# make an lp object with 0 constraints and 7 decision variables
lprec <- make.lp(0, 7)

# Creating objective function. The default is a minimization problem
set.objfn(lprec, c(775,800,800,800,800,775,750))

# Add the constraints

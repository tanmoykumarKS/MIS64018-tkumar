What mix of 3 new product needs to be produced my Emax Corporation.

Management wants primary consideration given to three factors: total profit, stability in the
workforce, and achieving an increase in the company’s earnings next year from the $75 million

Lets assume that x1 is the rate of production for Unit 1, x2 is the rate of production for Unit 2, x3 is the rate of production for Unit 3.

We introduce auxiliary variable y1n, y1n and y2n. These are variables will hold the value of the chnages or delta values. 

Now, Emax want to Maximize Z = P - 6C - 3D, 

where
P = total (discounted) profit over the life of the new products,
C = change (in either direction) in the current level of employment,
D = decrease (if any) in next year’s earnings from the current year’s level.

If we rewrite the objective function using the auxiliary variable, then objective function gets formulate like below:

Maximize P-6(y1p+y1n)-3y2n

Thus forming LP function as below: 

// Objective function
max: P -6 y1p - 6 y1n - 3 y2n;

There is no penalty for increase in profit thats why y2p is set to zero

// Constraints
6 x1 + 4 x2 + 5 x3 + y1n - y1p= 50;
8 x1 + 7 x2 + 5 x3 + y2n - y2p = 75;
20 x1 + 15 x2 + 25 x3 = P;


## Formulation and Solution

```{r}
mx <- read.lp("emax.lp")
mx
solve(mx)
get.objective(mx)
get.variables(mx)
```
Objective function value is 225 which is overall profit of the company 

Rate of production of Product 1 = 0
Rate of production of Product 2 = 0
Rate of production of Product 3 = 15

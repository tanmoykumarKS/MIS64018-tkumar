We will now run DEA analysis using the benchmarking library.

```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)
#install.packages("Benchmarking")
library(Benchmarking)

```

Now, we read our input data. We will read the data as input and output as vectors.
```{r}
x <- matrix(c(150,400,320,520,350,320,200,700,1200,2000,1200,700),ncol = 2)
y <- matrix(c(14000,14000,42000,28000,19000,14000,3500,21000,10500,42000,25000,15000),ncol = 2)
colnames(y) <- c("RemPatientDays","PrivatePaidDays")
colnames(x) <- c("StaffHrsPerDay","SuppPerDay")
x
y
```
We now run the DEA analysis. We use the option of CRS, Constant Return to Scale.
```{r}
e <- dea(x,y,RTS = "crs")  # provide the input and output 
e
peers(e)                       # identify the peers
lambda(e)                      # identify the relative weights given to the peers
#dea.plot.isoquant(x,y,RTS="crs")     # plot the results
```

The results indicate that DMUs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are efficient. DMU(6) is only 86% efficient, and DMU(5) is 97% efficient.
Further, the peer units for DMU(5) are 1, 2 and 4, with relative weights 0.20, 0.08 and 0.53. Similary for DMU(6), the peer units are 1, 2 and 4, with weights 0.34, 0.39 and 0.13, respectively.

We now run the DEA analysis. We use the option of FDH.
```{r}
e <- dea(x,y,RTS = "fdh")  # provide the input and output 
e
peers(e)                       # identify the peers
lambda(e)                      # identify the relative weights given to the peers
#dea.plot.isoquant(x,y,RTS="crs")     # plot the results
```


We now run the DEA analysis. We use the option of VRS. 
```{r}
e <- dea(x,y,RTS = "vrs")  # provide the input and output 
e
peers(e)                       # identify the peers
lambda(e)                      # identify the relative weights given to the peers
#dea.plot.isoquant(x,y,RTS="crs")     # plot the results
```


We now run the DEA analysis. We use the option of IRS 
```{r}
e <- dea(x,y,RTS = "irs")  # provide the input and output 
e
peers(e)                       # identify the peers
lambda(e)                      # identify the relative weights given to the peers
#dea.plot.isoquant(x,y,RTS="crs")     # plot the results
```

We now run the DEA analysis. We use the option of DRS 
```{r}
e <- dea(x,y,RTS = "drs")  # provide the input and output 
e
peers(e)                       # identify the peers
lambda(e)                      # identify the relative weights given to the peers
#dea.plot.isoquant(x,y,RTS="crs")     # plot the results
```

We now run the DEA analysis. We use the option of FRH 
```{r}
e <- dea(x,y,RTS = "add")  # provide the input and output 
e
peers(e)                       # identify the peers
lambda(e)                      # identify the relative weights given to the peers
#dea.plot.isoquant(x,y,RTS="crs")     # plot the results
```

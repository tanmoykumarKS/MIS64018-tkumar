Model name: 
  a linear program with 6 decision variables and 5 constraints
  
/* Objective function */
min: 22X600 x11 + 14X600 x12 + 30X600 x13 + 16X625 x21 + 20X625 x22 + 24X625 x23

/* Constraints */

x11 + x12 + x13 <=100
x21 + x22 + x23 <=120
x11 + x21 =80
x12 + x21 =60
x13 + x23 =70

Now, load the library
```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)
```
Let us set up the Heart Start transportation problem. We have 6 decision variables, and 5 constraints.
In the first formulation, we will directly create the objective function and constraints.

```{r}
# make an lp object with 0 constraints and 6 decision variables
lprec <- make.lp(0, 6)

# Creating objective function. The default is a minimization problem. 
set.objfn(lprec, c(13200,8400,18000,10000,12500,15000))

# As the default is a minimization problem, so no need to change the direction 

# Add the constraints
#Plant production Capacity constraints
add.constraint(lprec, c(1, 1, 1, 0 ,0 ,0), "<=", 100)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0, 0, 0, 1 ,1 ,1), "<=", 120)

#Warehouse demand constraints
add.constraint(lprec, c(1, 0, 0, 1, 0 ,0 ), "=", 80)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0, 1, 0, 0, 1 ,0 ), "=", 60)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ,1 ), "=", 70)


# Set bounds for variables explicitly.

set.bounds(lprec, lower = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), columns = c(1, 2,3,4,5,6)) 

# set variable names and name the constraints
RowNames <- c("PlantAProdCap", "PlantBProdCap", "Ware1Demand","Ware2Demand", "Ware3Demand")

ColNames <- c("PlantAWar1Quant", "PlantAWar2Quant", "PlantAWar3Quant", "PlantBWar1Quant", "PlantBWar2Quant", "PlantBWar3Quant")

dimnames(lprec) <- list(RowNames, ColNames)

# Now, print out the model
lprec

# The model can also be saved to a file
write.lp(lprec, filename = "HeartStart.lp", type = "lp")
```

We now solve the above LP problem
```{r}
solve(lprec)
```


We now output the value of the objective function, and the variables
```{r}
get.objective(lprec)
get.variables(lprec)
```


```{r}
x <- read.lp("HeartStart.lp") # create an lp object x
x                              # display x
```

Solve the lp model
```{r}
solve(x)
get.objective(x)        # get objective value
get.variables(x)        # get values of decision variables
get.constraints(x)      # get constraint RHS values
```
